# Custom Godot Scene Workshop
 A bunch of modular Scenes that I can just plop into any ol' project. Most of them are pretty barebones, intended to be simple starting points for getting features/mechanics/whatever up and running with a little less brainpower. I figured that if it can be useful to me, it may be helpful to someone else so, please, help yourself! It's only really here for safe keeping as the library is starting to grow a bit, so there isn't much I can do support-wise, but I'd be happy to answer any questions!
